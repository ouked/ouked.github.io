Researchers at OpenAI, Meta and Google have been exploring (and proving) how the performance of AI can be improved with the addition of
Intrinsic Rewards. (RND, NovelD, Psuedo counts)

## What is an Intrinsic Reward?

While an **extrinsic** reward is something tangible that comes from an individual's environment and will likely have 
some true value, an **intrinsic** reward is one whose worth comes from inside the recipient. 

An example could be a compliment from somebody you respect: it feels good, and we might even be tempted to try to maximise
the amount of positive feedback from this person. But, unlike money, food (which have a true, realisable value in the world),
the value is mostly internal and sentimental. 

While it could be tempting to dismiss the value of a reward that has no exchangeable value as worthless, chasing and attempting
to maximise intrinsic rewards is a valid, and common strategy.

Consider a young child. They don't yet have the ability to work for food or money, and must 
rely on the generosity and love of their carer. They receive no meaningful extrinsic rewards, where their behaviour
has an impact on what they receive: the child will always be fed (hopefully!), even if they haven't worked for it.

Without any external driving factors or a need to get the necessary nutrients to continue to live, we might expect the
child to do nothing - why would it? They will be fed and will continue to live either way. 

But we all know this isn't the case: the child will spend its days playing with toys it finds fascinating, it will ask
its carer about topics that the child is curious about, and will inspect pretty much anything it can get its hands on.

The child is intrinsically motivated to explore the world, regardless of the fact that they don't receive any extrinsic
reward for their behaviour. They do it because they're curious.

Perhaps this exploration will lead them to play with Lego, which will lead them to want to build mechanical toys, which
will give them the beginnings of the skills required to become a Mechanical Engineer later on in life, which will at last
provide them with money (and thus food). A child's curiosity can be seen as a heuristic to encourage future rewards. 

Carefully designed intrinsic rewards are likely to lead humans to an extrinsic reward.

Visualise a reward in your mind.

Did you think of gold coins? A trophy? Perhaps some food, if you're particularly hungry?


While these are rewards, they are all of a certain subclass of rewards: extrinsic rewards. These are all physical, real rewards that are 
provided to us by the environment in which we exist. These rewards are legitimate, and living life with the intention of
maximising these rewards is a viable and common way of existing.

But how is it that as children we can exist and thrive without receiving these rewards? They are driven by curiosity: an
intrinsic reward.
